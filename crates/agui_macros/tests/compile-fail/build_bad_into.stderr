error[E0277]: the trait bound `f32: From<Row>` is not satisfied

  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <f32 as From<i16>>
            <f32 as From<i8>>
            <f32 as From<u16>>
            <f32 as From<u8>>
            <f64 as From<f32>>
            <f64 as From<i16>>
            <f64 as From<i32>>
            <f64 as From<i8>>
          and 73 others
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<f32>` for `Row`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `build` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
