## What is Agui Widgets?

Agui Widgets is a crate containing a wide array of widgets for use in [`agui`](https://crates.io/crates/agui). This crate's widgets are somewhat opinionated design-wise, so if you need specific functionality feel free to peruse and yank out what you need until it develops further.
