## What is agui?

Agui is an advanced reactive GUI project for Rust, inspired by Flutter and taking some concepts from other related UI systems.

## WARNING

Agui is very much still in heavy active development. The API will likely change, and it has yet to go under rigorous testing. However, that's not to say it's not ready for moderate use.

# 🛠️ Installation

Agui is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/agui), Rust's official package repository. Just add this to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
agui = "0.1" # ensure this is the latest version
```

# 🚀 Usage

Docs for `agui` are under development, however you can check the `agui_agpu/examples` directory for basic setup, and `agui_widgets` for many examples on widget creation.

# 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are encouraged, and very welcome. Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/stumblinbear/agui/issues) if you wish to do so!

Please go through existing issues and pull requests to check if somebody else is already working on it. Also, make sure to run `cargo test` before you commit your changes!
