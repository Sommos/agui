# Deeper Understanding

Understanding the internals of `agui` is not necessary to be productive while using it. For those just getting started, or those that need something that "just works," this is a fantastic place to stop reading. In fact, I suggest you do so. Everything you need to hear has already been said, everything you need to see has already been shown.

However, for those that wish to contribute (or those that are merely morbidly curious), the remainder of this book will give a good overview of how the internal systems work and function together. Further understanding exists by reading the code, should you desire it.

To keep things digestible, we'll start at the core systems and tack on layers from there, gradually increasing the complexity until every system has been explained in as deep of detail one can without too much technical jargon (in fact, the order in which it's explained is the order in which it was developed). By the end of it, either you'll be more confused than you started, or you'll run for the hills, because further reading is not for the inexperienced programmer, nor the faint of heart.

Here be dragons.
