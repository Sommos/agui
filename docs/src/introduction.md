# Introduction

**Agui** is a reactive UI library, built in pure Rust, made for pure Rust. It's inspired by Flutter and other reactive UI libraries, and almost more importantly: it's renderer-agnostic. There are a few basic concepts to learn, but if you come from a background of Flutter, React, Vue, or other similar libraries, you'll feel right at home.

## Stability Warning

While the core of `Agui` is mostly stable, it is still very much in its infancy. The API may change, and optimizations still need to be done, especially when it comes to talking to the render integrations, and the integrations themselves. We are still finding our way, and that will take time. That said: it works. If you need a feature that doesn't exist, feel free to contribute or make a plugin!
