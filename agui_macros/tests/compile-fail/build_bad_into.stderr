  |         ^^^^ the trait `From<Quad>` is not implemented for `f32`

  = help: the following implementations were found:
            <f32 as From<i16>>
            <f32 as From<i8>>
            <f32 as From<u16>>
            <f32 as From<u8>>
  = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Into<f32>` for `Quad`
